## Abstract
It  goes  without  saying  that  traditional  text-basedmemorizing   technique   is   not   effective.   The   problem   behindmemorizing  words  is  that  memorized  words  are  often  storedin  the  short-term  memory  of  our  brain,  not  in  the  long-termmemory  section.  In  practice,  combining  learning  activity  witha  forgetting  curve  has  been  proved  to  substantially  improve  theeffectiveness  of  studying.  In  this  paper,  we  make  the  first  studyto  enhance  human  memorization  via  the  forgetting  curve  usingthe  NUGU  AI  speaker.  The  user  goes  through  two  stages,  whichare  the  learning  and  test  stage.  In  the  learning  stage,  the  userrepetitively  learns  the  vocabulary  of  choice  and  the  NUGU  AIspeaker  helps  this  process  by  reading  the  word.
