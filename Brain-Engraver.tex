\begin{abstract}
It goes without saying that traditional text-based memorizing technique is not effective. The problem behind memorizing words is that memorized words are often stored in the short-term memory of our brain, not in the long-term memory section. In practice, combining learning activity with a forgetting curve has been proved to substantially improve the effectiveness of studying. In this paper, we make the first study to enhance human memorization via the forgetting curve using the NUGU AI speaker. The user goes through two stages, which are the learning and test stage. In the learning stage, the user repetitively learns the vocabulary of choice and the NUGU AI speaker helps this process by reading the word \begin{comment}and showing the nuance of the word with color\end{comment}. In the test stage, users are being tested with word lists, which comprises newly learned vocabularies and the words that have been selected by the forgetting curve technique.

\section{Introduction}
The most basic and crucial part of learning a foreign language would be “memorizing words”. To illustrate, we are frequently required to memorize a huge amount of vocabulary for a specific certificate or test. The traditional memorizing method, which is based on text, is neither efficient nor effective. To give you a clearer image, even if we memorize the words, it is very likely to be “stored” via the short-term memory, rather than the long-term memory. The shortcomings of this method are particularly evident when one needs to learn the pronunciation of words that are heard and spoken. In order to solve this issue, this paper aims to overcome the limitations of traditional word memorization methods with Brain Engraver which is run under the NUGU AI Speaker. Users using our software go through two stages every day, and these two stages are the learning stage and the test stage. In the learning stage, the user tries to learn and memorize the set of preselected words. The word set to learn can be selected from multiple word sets pre-stored in the application, users can add words directly to the word set, or even create a whole new set. When the learning stage begins, the NUGU AI speaker repeatedly reads the pronunciation and meaning of the word and then moves on to the next word after the user’s preset time. The number of words that are carried out in a single study(stage) is also set by the user himself. \begin{comment}When a speaker reads the meaning and pronunciation of the word, a light on the speaker flicks up, showing the subtle nuance of the vocabulary via colored light.\end{comment} 
In the second, testing stage, the user answers the meaning of the word spoken by the NUGU AI speaker. The test word set consists of a new set of words memorized by the user and a list of previously memorized words. It calculates the review cycle by the forgetting curve and gives a question that the user will be most likely to be forgotten. This prevents unnecessary repetition of quizzes and helps you to move your short-term-memorized vocabulary into long-term memory. Furthermore, the word is specified into sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory categories, thereby creating a new review word list the following day.

    \item Inside the word set, there should exist a list of sub-words sets to learn (e.g., Chapter 1, Chapter 2…)
    \item The user should be able to add, delete the specific sub-word set of their choice.
    \item There should be a checkbox next to these sub word sets in order to show that the user has already learned or currently learning the specific sub word set.
    \item The checkbox changes into green if the user finished the whole process; learning stage and the test stage, and into yellow if the user only finished the learning stage.
    \end{enumerate}
\item Word
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Inside the sub-word sets, the users should be able to see the list of words itself.
    \item This word list comprises ‘spelling’, ‘meaning’ and ‘play button’ which plays the pronunciation of the word. 
    \item The user should be able to add, delete the specific word of their choice.
    \item There should be a checkbox next to these words in order to show that the user has already learned or currently learning the specific word.

% The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
% column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
% alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
% measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
% and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
% as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
% Please do not revise any of the current designations.

% \section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
% Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
% separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
% formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
% proofreading, spelling and grammar.

% Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
% formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
% for you.

% \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
% Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
% even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
% IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
% abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

% \subsection{Units}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
% \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
% \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
% \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively. To make your 
% equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
% appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
% but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
% sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
% sentence, as in:
% \begin{equation}
% a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
% \end{equation}

% Be sure that the 
% symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
% the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

% \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

% {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
% data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

% {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3. 

% {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
% \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
% \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
% \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
% \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
% \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
% \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
% \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
% \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
% \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
% \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
% \end{itemize}
% An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

% \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
% \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
% minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
% should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
% next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
% and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
% affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
% example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

% \subsection{Identify the Headings}
% Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
% your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

% Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
% topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
% References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
% ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
% table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
% style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
% down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
% example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
% material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
% sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
% and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
% should be introduced.

% \subsection{Figures and Tables}
% \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
% bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
% figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
% below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
% figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
% ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

% Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
% rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
% avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
% ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
% units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
% with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
% \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
% quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
% ``Temperature/K''.

% \section*{Acknowledgment}

% The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
% an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
% G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
% acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

% \section*{References}

% Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
% sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
% number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

% Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
% the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
% abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

% Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
% ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
% submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
% that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
% Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
% element symbols.

% For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
% citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
